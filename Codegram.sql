Had about 5 months of experience in IT and web development and applied for hundreds of jobs in both fields and never made the cut. I cycled between feeling awful about myself and being just less than content and I lost confidence in almost every area of my life. On top of this, I lived with my parents who would often tell me I wasn\'t trying hard enough even though I felt like I was. This past 11 months of unemployment have genuinely been the worst period of my life.But today I got offers from 2 jobs and it feels like a colossal weight has been lifted off my shoulders.Believe it or not, both of these jobs came from recruiters approaching me and asking me to apply for some positions and I\'m so glad I did. I guess the takeaway from this is that it doesn\'t hurt to stylise both your CV and your LinkedIn profile  to make them pop out more.','cscareerquestions','11 months post graduation but I\'ve finally done it',1),('t2_976uekcg','Not my main account because I know some of my coworkers/friends browse this sub and would recognize me.  I just want to rant and encourage people to keep looking for remote jobs and make the transition if they can/prefer it.So last week, after a year or so working from home, I had to go back (for the first time in my career) into the office. According to my company, we should work from the office because it will increase collaboration and people will perform better.  Bunch of bs, but I had no other choice at the moment.So first things first, instead of waking up at 8:20 and join a useless meeting at 8:30, be on mute and proceed to go make my breakfast and take my dog for a walk,  I now have to wake up at 7, get properly dressed (no more comfortable clothes), make sure I have lunch and breakfast prepped, get on the highway, drive, get there at 8:15, mindless chit chat till 8:30, join the same useless meeting on zoom (with coworkers from around the globe, what\'s the f. point? ) and now I HAVE to/MUST pretend to pay attention to something that has no relation to what I work with because well, I got no more flexibility on my surrounding environment.At home, I invested in a nice work setup. I have a nice chair, a stand-up desk, wireless keyboard/mouse/headphones, 2 monitors that I can adjust, plus a private kitchen to make my snacks, and teas.The first time I went to the office and I saw the work environment I felt ridiculous. It\'s a fucking cubicle, with a shitty keyboard, mouse, and headset. The best part is that the cubicle doesn\'t have tall walls so I can literally see/hear everything, including other people\'s monitors.  The monitors, of course, are facing the hallway, so you can\'t see who\'s walking behind you, but whoever walks past you can freely see what you are doing.  Manager\'s dream.I also have to wait in line now if I want to make some tea or something, delightful.At home, I am able to have a quiet environment and be super productive. When I get a card, depending on what it is, I can finish it in 2-4 hours, and then I can focus on doing something else for the rest of the day (learning/training, other meetings, or just not work at all since I was able to be productive).At the office, because of being constantly watched, I became lazy just to have something to hold on to/last for the rest of the day. I also noticed that my team members do the same.  Also for me, IT IS EXTREMELY HARD to actually focus with a lot of background noise and as I mentioned above, because of the cubicles, every time someone gets up (every 10 mins), or gets a phone call, my attention is drawn to that and I lose what focus I had.The company kept saying we will be more productive at the office. That\'s the opposite of what I am seeing. My team is now taking longer for cards, and the amount of time wasted in the office is ridiculous. The number of people, mindless walking around, chit-chatting in cubicles, going out for lunch/ coffee breaks just to fill in the time is a joke(nothing wrong with that IMO, but I\'d rather do that at home).I loved having a private bathroom at my house. I can go and do whatever I want to do in peace. At the office, welcome to the shitty stalls and pooping side by side because, yes, I do love the smell of people farting in the morning.The people that wanted to go back into the office, after a week of going to work and lunches and whatnot, started to mention some stuff during the stand-ups and I quote:\"Are you guys feeling more tired than usual?  I forgot I didn\'t enjoy the commute\"\"Man I forgot it sucked to have to prep a meal every day and wait in line in the cafeteria to reheat it\"\"I actually didn\'t realize I was saving money eating at home, I spent over 100 dollars last week on coffee and lunch\".At home, after work, I could go for a jog right away or just go watch some Netflix and chill out.At the office after a long, tiring day? Nope, get in the car, you are going to waste 40 minutes in stressful traffic to get home.​I am FUCKING glad, I am putting in my 2 weeks this Wednesday and going fully remote. I started looking 4 months ago when the company announced their plans because I was feeling that this office thing would be horrible. I tried it out and it just doesn\'t work for me.If you are looking for a remote role, keep applying/interviewing, you will get something too.If you like/prefer going to the office that is fine. I am not trying to say we should all be remote. Companies should offer FLEXIBILITY to let employees choose where to work from.We have different personalities and different preferences. Just because some people enjoy going into the office (or because management needs control) doesn\'t mean everyone has to.​I am gladly never going to or near an office ever again.​TL;DR: Went to the office for the first time in my life. I hated it and makes no sense to me.  Companies should let employees decide where to work from. If they can\'t offer that and make their employee\'s lives easier/better, they should/will lose all their talent to companies that do.​EDIT 1: There seems to be a lot of people saying that I am entitled. For a bit of background, I started working a couple of years ago as a dishwasher and made my way to where I am right now. I never had an easy path nor a college degree (I am self-taught with a small coding Bootcamp).Just because I prefer having a better quality of life/work, doesn\'t mean I am entitled. Instead of bickering with each other about who works harder or whatever, we should focus on having a better quality of life and trying to make it the norm.

Sometimes, when I’m writing code and things start going wrong, my mind goes into this complete downward spiral of stress, confusion, and anxiety and suddenly I find it 5 times harder to complete the task at hand. It then feels like my mind is a complete mess.To give an example, I was doing online coding challenges today to practice for interviews. The first few problems went quite smoothly and I was happy. But then I got tripped up on one involving removal of an element from a linked list. It dragged on for an hour and a half and this ruined my day.

From the Hospital, I went to my mother\'s basement, where, after being in a hospital bed on round the clock morphine and ativan for more than a month I was unable to spend more than 5 minutes upright/out of bed without getting debilitating migraines/spinal headaches. Was a fun time.The positive thing though was I had a lot of time to think. About how my life was going to look very different than I expected/wanted it to. How I probably wasn\'t going to be able to live the way I want to, or get all the things I dreamed I one day would. That unless I took direct action to change my situation, the rest of my life was probably going to look something like the room I was currently lying in, wasting away on disability waiting to die. This was not acceptable to me, so I spent my time trying to think of a way to circumvent this scenario.The only thing that seemed to check all the boxes in terms of work I could actually see myself doing, that payed well and allowed the flexibility that will sometimes be necessary for a chronic health condition was software.I had never done any programming up until that point, but always liked computers, playing with them, fixing them, reading about how they worked. And I kept hearing all this talk about boot camps and not needing a bachelors degree and then I met a developer who was working with my mother who also happened to be starting a boot camp. Finding it unlikely a better opportunity would come across my path, I jumped at the opportunity.I found a state offered grant to pay for the tuition, as medical bills had eaten through all of my savings, and threw myself into the bootcamp and coding in general - I told myself, \"hobbies are something you can have once you are a developer. Right now something else needs to be your focus.\"I stopped reading, playing videogames, trying to date, and did my best to put as much time as possible into learning to code and learning to learn. After the 3 month cohort they asked me to come back and help teach with the next cohort and I jumped at the opportunity - a way to get to take the course again and get paid to do so? Sign me up.While I was helping teach part time I was also applying for dev jobs, but not getting many offers. The couple I did get were filled with red flags, for very little pay, usually in other states without a relocation bonus. But one of the local companies I interviewed with liked me - just not as a dev. They offered me a position as a QA Analyst. And I took the position! I just wanted to be closer to software, and working on a software dev team at a software company was a huge step in the right direction.I used my time in QA to figure out how to automate and streamline different parts of the development lifecycle - in just a couple months, when I asked for a promotion to a SDET position, It was granted! I was so happy I cried, but I knew there was still more work to do.I stayed in the SDET position for almost two years, all the while continuing to work part time with boot camps as a TA so that I could continue to learn and stay hungry. After two years, I no longer felt I was getting what I wanted out of my current position so I started interviewing again.While this round was SO much easier than the first, it seemed like recruiters were very quick to pigeonhole me into the position of QA/Automation work, which is what I was trying to get out of. After a couple months I did get a couple offers I liked and made the move somewhere new.The new place was amazing, and I\'m so grateful I got to work and learn next to so many brilliant people, but after two years It didn\'t feel like I was learning something new every day. Was feeling stagnant, and not excited by the tickets. With everyone in the office knowing that my last role dealt with a lot of testing, a lot of test or CD/CI questions would naturally just come my way. I got to do interesting non-test related work of course, and at the end wasn\'t doing anything more test related than making sure my PR\'s had adequate coverage but i still felt the shadow lurking just out of sight.But this new position is just... the real deal.They\'re not \"giving me a chance because i\'m a tester who looks like they would make a good dev\"I was hired solely based on my ability to develop software - and after years of using every trick in the book to inch closer and closer to a reality where that could happen, it feels like I\'ve finally made it.I don\'t know if this is the right place to post this, but I just wanted to share my thoughts with people who may be in a similar position or headspace and encourage you to keep going, and don\'t give up. Most of the time, from what I see, whether or not someone can find success in software is a question of two things;A. Are you willing to do the work?Software is hard and can be frustrating and boring. It\'s not going to magically get easier by not doing it practice, study, live eat and breathe coding and it will get easier. This doesn\'t have to be forever - but it does have to be right now.B. Are you willing to get denied hundreds, thousands of times and keep tryingI had to put out more than a thousand job applications before getting my first position. I know some people who get jobs putting out a lot fewer, but the people I see not getting jobs are the ones who give up. If you keep practicing and learning, and keep putting out applications, eventually you will find the right opportunity. Not getting discouraged is the hardest part.If you\'ve read all the way to the end, well, I apologize for the improvised novel and thank you for your time.

I was an experienced IT solutions architect (not in software engineering) in my home country, and was hired by a big tech international company in Europe for a support position on mid-level grade. I thought that was fine since I don\'t have European citizenship. I then quickly realized that they were gonna squeeze all the juice out of me to achieve their business goals and since then I learned programming languages and was engaged in many different projects, I was coding during the nights since my job didn\'t give any chance to code during normal working hours. Despite the fact that some of the projects were really important to our company and were having a big impact, my manager didn\'t allow me to disengage from  my core duties. Even though he admitted the importance of those projects I wasn\'t promoted to senior level nor did I get a salary increase. This is how I realized that he\'s bullshiting me and I have no future in this department. I then tried to apply to internal SWE positions in other departments. It was almost impossible to get the role in my current country since most of the European roles were opened in the UK or in Poland. My hope was to get a relocation and start working at a junior level, it still gives more chances than trying to join another company in the EU without an unrestricted work permit. However all the attempts failed until 3 months ago,  I applied for site reliability engineering position in a different department of my company. All of the sudden, just a few days after a few interviews my manager got me a promotion, I think he realized that I am about to quit. Anyway I got the offer. The position offered software engineering duties - actually a lot of job time is coding. My support position helped to get it because it requires systems engineering and troubleshooting skills too. That was a big success and I am pretty happy I finally left the customer support departmentand can start the new journey in the new team which seems to be very nice and supportive.','cscareerquestions','I finally got my first software engineering related job.',7),('t2_kapfh','got a software job right out of college and I\'ve been in the same company for 5 ~ 6 years.

Now, my heart already left the current company and not very motivated for the work, and WFH environment is not helping either. So I am thinking about quitting the current job, taking few months off until my next interview opportunity in the FAANG comes back up. The question is, until now, getting to the interview stage was fairly easy. The recruiters would ask about current job position then would set up the interview date.

Almost everyone with a MS in Data Science is able to get a job as a data scientist. So I should apply to MS in DS, but it\'ll blow away my cover for Software Engineering roles which I would not like but are a good backup in the long run. 3.
