I\'ve had multiple people show interest in my work especially with my latest compensation level, work life balance, and great treatment by my employers. This is with people from different walks of life but my circle is generally younger (15-30). Some have careers they are unhappy with, some are younger folks still in school, some are actually even taking CS in school. It\'s incredibly difficult to get them motivated. Career switchers? Yeah, you take an afternoon to sit with some code with them or even just teach them the basics? They feel overwhelmed with even 4-5 lines of code. They get lost what is happening, start doubting if coding is for them and if they can do this. This is with them watching highly rated tutorials and me there 1 on 1 with them to ask questions or explain things. Unreal. These aren\'t even dumb people but smart people in their career for a few years or even just starting out their career. They\'ll then procrastinate the next lessons and well, that never gets anywhere. Like... am I just a bad teacher? But I\'ve tried online tutorials to start with instead of me teaching too but the results are the same. We don\'t reach very far before it\'s over...People in CS? Yeah, you tell them internships matter and if you can\'t get that, go do side projects to atleast keep your resume strong. Well, they\'ll get lazy and do other things instead. You just watch them burn away their time and become a weaker and weaker candidate. They don\'t seem to understand that getting an entry level job is probably the worst thing they\'ll ever go through in their career even if you emphasise it many times.Younger kids still in school? Smart enough to know that most jobs nowadays do not pay a living wage. Aware enough to escape the whole \"follow your dreams and do something you love\" platitudes we had growing up. Not motivated at all to start some coding even if they want to go this career path as it\'s a bright future for them to pursue their hobbies or go for early retirement.There\'s actually a bit of effort involved to learning and getting into tech but I can\'t seem to find anyone with that drive to do so. It\'s actually a bit demotivating and I don\'t know if I want to try helping anyone with advice or even teaching them in the future. You do need effort and drive but you honestly don\'t even need that much to succeed.

I have over 5 years of experience, though with most of them freelancing, I can\'t say I know what to expect of a more \"traditional\" hiring experience.I applied through LinkedIn to a job at a relatively small company (less than 100 employees). While I received a response, there was nearly nothing at all discussed--in fact, literally the only question I was asked was \"you\'re looking for something full time, right?\"Immediately following that single question: \"what\'s your GitHub username so we can send you a code test?\"To be fair, the code test doesn\'t seem like anything that would be used in a production product, so I doubt this is a case of the company looking for free work.Still, this just strikes me as odd. No interview, no discussion, (nearly) no questions, no \"tell us more about yourself\", nothing asking about my past work or experience--just a single question about making sure I want a full time job, followed by \"alright, then do this code test\". Not even any mention of how soon they\'d like it done by, for that matter.Does this sound standard, or should I be taking this as a red flag of some sort? It\'s not like the coding task is that difficult--maybe a handful of hours at most. But I mean... I guess my point is that this feels like it\'s still a part of the application stage. With how little discussion there\'s been, it\'s hard for me to feel confident that this is worth my time; this feels less like \"the final hurdle to be sure we want to hire you\", and more \"the barrier to entry on if we even want to talk to you.\"Does this sound like standard procedure, and something I should just expect?

I bombed on 2 interviews for 2 separate companies, but the interviewers were both very similar to each other. To illustrate, I was asked to return the kth largest integer from an unsorted array of integers. I was solving it in python and decided to use heapq to build a min heap of size k and iterate over the array. Once completed the item on top of the heap is the kth largest int. The interviewer didn\'t like that. He told me to instead use the input array itself as a buffer and keep it sorted (O(1) memory). With some struggles I managed to do it, but I think I took a little too long because I was a little flustered at being interrupted regularly and I could not understand his accent at times.

I\'ve seen a few posts regarding dropping out, but I think my situation might be a bit different? I\'m not really sure.I interned at a FAANG company last summer, and got a return offer, so I\'m interning for them again now. My project seems actually meaningful and nontrivial this time, and things seem to be going well.But I have a strong desire to drop out of college (CS degree, have 2 years left), most of which stems from the fact that I think it\'s very expensive and very uninteresting. Last semester was really rough, I remember feeling super disgusted with the fact that I had homework to do, and was generally suicidal because of it.This leads to my beloved personal hobby at the moment, which is competitive programming. Unlike homework problems, the issue isn\'t understanding what you\'re being asked and then following instructions, but instead whether your problem solving skills/creativity are strong enough. I\'m decently satisfied with my improvement, got google code jam rank \\~550 after 2 years of learning :\\^) But anyways, the point is that I feel college is extremely dull in comparison.So back to the question I guess, does anyone have an estimation on the probability of me receiving a fulltime interview from some respectable tech company? In addition to my internships, I\'ve done a few projects, the primary one being a react/aws web app I\'ve worked on for \\~7 months. In theory, I should have a very high interview to offer conversion rate, so it\'s possible that a single interview would suffice.You could also try to convince me not to drop out? idk lol, a much bigger chance of staying alive plus \\~300k of opportunity cost over 2 years seems to outweigh any harm in getting shafted by employers due to no degree imoI\'ve applied to around 5-10 positions so far, and it\'s only been a week or two, but I feel like my inbox is gonna remain empty unless I do more :/Thanks for reading my mini-rant!','cscareers','How difficult is it to get a fulltime software engineering interview as a college dropout?'),('t2_hhddu','','cscareers','The Seven Flags of a Toxic Work Environment.

I still apply because what\'s there to lose, but yeah, to no avail. And now, I got spam emails and random phone calls from Recruiters asking if I\'m interested in Sr. Software Engineer roles. Like bruh.I\'ve had my resume checked and revamped by friends who I consider exceptional students (working at: Twitter, Salesforce, LinkedIn, Amazon), So I don\'t feel like my resume is the issue. I got at least one not-special internship from a small company under my belt so that must mean something I guess.The only thing I feel lacking is that I am a hybrid major (Half CS + Half LA). The college I fall into is LA still so my education says \"BS in Liberal Arts and Computer Science\". I\'m feeling that maybe recruiters just instantly see \"Liberal Arts\" and chuck it away. At the same time, I don\'t feel like my major is that much of a concern as alumni from my major pretty much all end up as software engineers. And the college itself is quite reputable / top ranking in California. But it is a very new and small department with only a handful of students. The pool of alumni is incredibly small with only software engineer examples.I\'m starting to doubt myself on whether I\'m applying to the right things or using my major correctly. I\'ve mainly been applying for software QA roles as TDD feels like the main thing I\'ve taken away from college with friends motioning for me to get into the same field. At the same time, I\'ve been advised to look into consulting positions which I\'ve been applying to as well (but honestly more interested in an engineering role) with about as much success as my software job search.I just don\'t know if I\'m taking the job hunting path correctly. For software engineer roles, I\'ve been trying to learn popular frameworks but feel like there\'s too much new stuff for my bad-at-retaining-memory brain can handle. Unless I\'m doing something consistently, it all disappears from my brain given 1-2 weeks time. I\'ve done probably 200 applications since Spring with only a handful of interviews.Worst to me being that I never was the best programmer. I was known for getting projects done fast, but not efficiently since I brute force hard and stayed up late hours. So my algorithm skills suck which leetcode has made me realize nonstop. Is my direction just bad? Any tips for job hunting for people of my situation?
