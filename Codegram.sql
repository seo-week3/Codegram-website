I work in C# .NET Core and frankly I feel like my job is almost not even related to programming. Most of the time I\'m just jerking around with some framework, some external tool or calling an api and sending something to another api and copy pasting the same code and writing basic tests. A lot of my job is just clicking buttons on AWS and running pipelines. Maybe I\'m just a bit delusional, but I always wanted to write code - something challenging, something that needs to perform well and something that makes me feel like I\'ve actually figured something out and not just deciphered what some Twilio doc says or why an image isn\'t loading properly. I see people discussing code performance, runtime speed, memory allocation and how their software works and does impressive stuff and I feel inadequate as a programmer and in fact I feel that I\'m not even a programmer. No offense to anyone who enjoys backend work for course, but often it just feels like you\'re not really doing anything (to me personally) aside from devOps type stuff, AWS stuff and rewriting some API controller, maybe sometimes you need to use a new library, but 99% of the time you basically just go online, look at the documentation and it pretty much tells you word for word what to do and it\'s like UseLibrary() and RunLibrary() so you write like 5 lines of code, write 10 tests, deploy it and that\'s it, but I feel like I\'m not actually doing anything and that basically anyone could do this job - there\'s no thinking involved aside from trying to figure out what the documentation is saying sometimes or trial and error until you get the result you want.In short I suppose - I feel like my work is boring and that I almost don\'t write any code, but I wish I could. I know there are people who write high performance, critical code and it just seems so interesting, but I don\'t even know where to look for these kinds of jobs or what skills they require? I feel inadequate as a programmer and idk where to even begin \"getting good\" at \"real\" programming if that makes sense?

I feel very defeated because I am a smart student, I try my best but I just don\'t have the same support they do.I recently started solving programming problems on leetcode and it has left me very defeated as easy problems sometimes take hours and medium problems could take days.

I\'ve had multiple people show interest in my work especially with my latest compensation level, work life balance, and great treatment by my employers. This is with people from different walks of life but my circle is generally younger (15-30). Some have careers they are unhappy with, some are younger folks still in school, some are actually even taking CS in school. It\'s incredibly difficult to get them motivated. Career switchers? Yeah, you take an afternoon to sit with some code with them or even just teach them the basics? They feel overwhelmed with even 4-5 lines of code. They get lost what is happening, start doubting if coding is for them and if they can do this. This is with them watching highly rated tutorials and me there 1 on 1 with them to ask questions or explain things. Unreal. These aren\'t even dumb people but smart people in their career for a few years or even just starting out their career. They\'ll then procrastinate the next lessons and well, that never gets anywhere. Like... am I just a bad teacher? But I\'ve tried online tutorials to start with instead of me teaching too but the results are the same. We don\'t reach very far before it\'s over...People in CS? Yeah, you tell them internships matter and if you can\'t get that, go do side projects to atleast keep your resume strong. Well, they\'ll get lazy and do other things instead. You just watch them burn away their time and become a weaker and weaker candidate. They don\'t seem to understand that getting an entry level job is probably the worst thing they\'ll ever go through in their career even if you emphasise it many times.Younger kids still in school? Smart enough to know that most jobs nowadays do not pay a living wage. Aware enough to escape the whole \"follow your dreams and do something you love\" platitudes we had growing up. Not motivated at all to start some coding even if they want to go this career path as it\'s a bright future for them to pursue their hobbies or go for early retirement.There\'s actually a bit of effort involved to learning and getting into tech but I can\'t seem to find anyone with that drive to do so. It\'s actually a bit demotivating and I don\'t know if I want to try helping anyone with advice or even teaching them in the future.

I have about 8 years of development experience and a Masters in CS. I got the F250 job around March 2020. Its been great so far. My first year at this F250 I learned everything about the business and contributed pretty quickly and regularly to the team. My manager\'s mid year review (6 months in) was \"you\'ve started contributing regularly and learning a lot; and as for improvements, there are none, you just need time.\"At my 1 year review in March of 2021, I was told that I had done a fantastic job, everyone on my team is impressed. My manager said again \"you\'ve done everything we could want and as for improvements, there are none, just get involved in more leadership, mentoring and learning more\" From the beginning, the team I was on was 15 people (3 seniors, 9 devs) + Team lead, scrum master, and BA. From my 6 month mark when I was regularly contributing, management has transferred EVERY DEV out except me. They only recently brought 1 more in. They were xferred out because other teams are abysmal and floundering and need help. I am the team at this point. I have picked up everyone\'s slack and regularly produce quality code, manage sql db/mongo, learning requirements, and even devOps. My team lead is also the product owner so he doesn\'t actually code much, but he is good at conveying requirements and handling bullshit so I can keep my head down and churn out stories.  When this F250 pays out bonus, they do so around Feb, so I on my 1 year review I was told I didn\'t qualify for a bonus because I had only worked there 11 months and 2 weeks instead of 12 months. (approx $6-10k bonus based on contract). No raise either. I was pretty annoyed but expected this.Since my 1 year review, I have taken on more work and found some insidious bugs that the old devs created. It required a major re-write *to half the code base*. I did this solo. Fast forward to last week, I had my mid year review where I was described as \"the technical cornerstone, critical, and someone people look up to.\" I\'ve been given a mentor who is another team lead in another department and my manager wants me to seek out more leadership opportunities. Of course I got no raise. So at this point, what should I do ? I\'ve never worked in a huge company before so navigating management and politics is new to me and I have kept my head down in that respect. I do quality work with no fuss and am low maintenance. I did start interviewing outside and am now courting offers that are a mix of +45k-90k on what I currently make, 10% bonus, RSU or equity.  I\'ve read that bringing in an outside offer kills any potential of raises/promotions because you are a flight risk. I enjoy my job because its ridiculously easy but I wont be able to WFH anymore (absolutely no exceptions) after Labor Day. That is a big deal for me since I\'ll have to pay $ for parking / commuting too. All these new jobs I\'ve interviewed at are WFH and pay way more. I value WFH a lot, I\'m extremely comfortable and since I have ADHD I am able to work at my own pace and how I want to at home.

I was solving it in python and decided to use heapq to build a min heap of size k and iterate over the array. Once completed the item on top of the heap is the kth largest int. The interviewer didn\'t like that. He told me to instead use the input array itself as a buffer and keep it sorted (O(1) memory).

I\'ve seen a few posts regarding dropping out, but I think my situation might be a bit different? I\'m not really sure.I interned at a FAANG company last summer, and got a return offer, so I\'m interning for them again now. My project seems actually meaningful and nontrivial this time, and things seem to be going well.But I have a strong desire to drop out of college (CS degree, have 2 years left), most of which stems from the fact that I think it\'s very expensive and very uninteresting. Last semester was really rough, I remember feeling super disgusted with the fact that I had homework to do, and was generally suicidal because of it.This leads to my beloved personal hobby at the moment, which is competitive programming. Unlike homework problems, the issue isn\'t understanding what you\'re being asked and then following instructions, but instead whether your problem solving skills/creativity are strong enough. I\'m decently satisfied with my improvement, got google code jam rank \\~550 after 2 years of learning :\\^) But anyways, the point is that I feel college is extremely dull in comparison.So back to the question I guess, does anyone have an estimation on the probability of me receiving a fulltime interview from some respectable tech company? In addition to my internships, I\'ve done a few projects, the primary one being a react/aws web app I\'ve worked on for \\~7 months.

I still apply because what\'s there to lose, but yeah, to no avail. And now, I got spam emails and random phone calls from Recruiters asking if I\'m interested in Sr. Software Engineer roles. Like bruh.I\'ve had my resume checked and revamped by friends who I consider exceptional students (working at: Twitter, Salesforce, LinkedIn, Amazon), So I don\'t feel like my resume is the issue. I got at least one not-special internship from a small company under my belt so that must mean something I guess.The only thing I feel lacking is that I am a hybrid major (Half CS + Half LA). The college I fall into is LA still so my education says \"BS in Liberal Arts and Computer Science\". I\'m feeling that maybe recruiters just instantly see \"Liberal Arts\" and chuck it away. At the same time, I don\'t feel like my major is that much of a concern as alumni from my major pretty much all end up as software engineers. And the college itself is quite reputable / top ranking in California. But it is a very new and small department with only a handful of students. The pool of alumni is incredibly small with only software engineer examples.I\'m starting to doubt myself on whether I\'m applying to the right things or using my major correctly. I\'ve mainly been applying for software QA roles as TDD feels like the main thing I\'ve taken away from college with friends motioning for me to get into the same field. At the same time, I\'ve been advised to look into consulting positions which I\'ve been applying to as well (but honestly more interested in an engineering role) with about as much success as my software job search.I just don\'t know if I\'m taking the job hunting path correctly. For software engineer roles, I\'ve been trying to learn popular frameworks but feel like there\'s too much new stuff for my bad-at-retaining-memory brain can handle. Unless I\'m doing something consistently, it all disappears from my brain given 1-2 weeks time. I\'ve done probably 200 applications since Spring with only a handful of interviews.Worst to me being that I never was the best programmer. I was known for getting projects done fast, but not efficiently since I brute force hard and stayed up late hours. So my algorithm skills suck which leetcode has made me realize nonstop.

I have 3.5 years of experience as Data Engineer and want to make a career move in Data Science.','datasciencecareers','Online Affordable Masters in Data Science??'),('t2_4doqe1bq','Hi, I hope everyone is doing well in these testing times! I am an Electronics and Communications engineer and have been working as a data analyst for the past 3 years. Most of my work also entails predictive models like XGBoost and recently I have also picked up some NLP. Now I am looking to apply for a Masters degree. I feel that there are other MS in CS vs MS in DS reddit posts out there but my confusion is a bit more deep, so I\'ll try my best to structure it well. 1. I do not have a background in CS, most of the folks I\'ve seen do well in Data Science (Analytics or ML Engineer) usually have a bachelor\'s in CS. So should I do a MS in CS. 2. Almost everyone with a MS in Data Science is able to get a job as a data scientist. So I should apply to MS in DS, but it\'ll blow away my cover for Software Engineering roles which I would not like but are a good backup in the long run. 3. Since most software Devs or data scientists will be in management positions later on in their career, it does not matter that I don\'t have backup software engineer roles because I will be a manager and I don\'t like software Dev roles. 4. MS DS programs are few in number and my overall profile is not that good to get into great programs. My background is not in CS so it also limits my options for MS CS. 5. I applied to a mix of MSCS and MSDS programs this year and got into UT Dallas MSCS and USFCA MSDS. I am considering building a stronger profile and applying again but only in either MSCS or MSDS. As you can see I\'m using a lot of variables to think about this. I am probably overthinking, yes. But I seriously want to make a good decision. I would really appreciate perspectives that would help me think and opinions that don\'t digress a lot from the mentioned points. Thanks!','datasciencecareers','Help me prune my cay decision tree'),('t2_ahzhh3te','I have a bachelor\'s in geology and currently doing my masters in applied geology , how can get change my career to data science and get jobs in that field?','datasciencecareers','How to do that?'),('t2_c2xtqj9f','What are the things one needs to consider when choosing a data scientist career between these two functional areas- in terms of growth, job availability, work type etc? Thx','datasciencecareers','Customer vs People Analytics Data Scientist'),('t2_bptzddeu','I graduated with a Physics Masters degree last year and I\'m still not completely sure what I want to do now. I\'m currently working as an IT Consultant which is okay, but involves leading meetings with customers the majority of the day, most days of the week. I don\'t mind working with customers, and I can do it, however I am quite an introverted person and the amount that I have to work with customers now is very tiring. I\'ve been looking into a career in Data Science, and have started a course on Udemy to try to expand my skills. However from what I\'ve found online, working with customers to understand their needs seems to be a large part of being a data scientist as well. The thing I most enjoyed in my degree was using Python to collect, clean up, analyze and present data, and even though I still have a lot to learn I feel like it would be worth pursuing a career in Data Science. I don\'t mind working with customers, again I can do it, I just don\'t want it to be most of what I do like it is now. Ideally I\'d want to work mostly on my own or in a team, occasionally working with customers and other people. Is this realistic, or should I try looking for a different career in a different field?','datasciencecareers','Data Science Career for introverts');
