That\'s when they hired me, putting me in charge of leading that initiative.The VP told me that he wants this done because he thought AS/400 was now obsolete, and it would become increasingly difficult to find talent.As someone who has a lot of experience with Azure and AWS, I also thought the system was an absolute dinosaur and that it needed to go. Also, I prefer working with Azure and AWS, so that\'s another reason I found myself agreeing with the VP.One year later, I\'m not sure if my reasons for wanting to migrate are valid.

Let\'s say Aron, Brian and colt. We all had come up with ideas for the paper, so far so good. Then comes the banger, 2 guys, aron and Brian didn\'t even know that we had to come up with literature material for us to start with, so their project idea was scrapped. Colt, who\'s a basic bitch mind you, comes up with an oh so brilliant idea of doing something covid related, didn\'t know what but he thinks he\'s revolutionary for coming up with that. Still I\'m fine with it, you know at least better than those other two fools. My idea was automating the gardening process, or at least mage it easier you know like indoor farming but on a smaller scale. Both me and the Colt go back and forth as to what project idea to go through. He\'s point was since \"covid is going on will do something related to that, and everybody will think we are geniuses\". I said ok but what will we do? Then he said \"what about an automatic screening for to check for covid, that will be installed as doors before entering any buildings\". Now that\'ll be cool and all, IF ONLY it was last year. Everyone has come up with something like that and it won\'t be anything new or research worthy. Mind you we had to come up with something that it either not widely used or something new. And since that project was easier Aaron and Brian backed him up saying it\'ll be easier for them too.But then again I was still happy that at least it\'s a positive argument about the project idea. Looking at subs like csMajors and others like it I had a negative impression on group projects. Then came the week to submit the project idea, this is where EVERYTHING started going downhill.Just as I suspected when we gave the project idea to the professor responsible, he started asking \"what new will you be doing?\"  Oh those dreaded words, and since that day was the last LAST day to submit the project topic, we had no other choices but to bs ourselves through it. Colt started shitting himself (metaphorically), Aaron and Brian started looking at the ceiling as to avoid the subject matter itself and since I was the project leader I had to pull myself through it somehow. Finally after a lot of thinking I said we\'ll be doing a economic case study as sort of, to see whether the automatic screening more profitable to an organisation rather than keeping an actual security guard for manual screening.Then, I think the professor saw through the bs but didn\'t give a Fk so finally said ok.Now after that happened, we decided who will do which part, and then after a week when we all showed each other our work, fkkkkk, these morons, Aaron and Brian didn\'t do anything, Colt who was the main guy for this idea wrote a one page summary about it, and mind you we had to do actual research, take data from actual experiments, cite research papers for validations but none of them did anything. I lost it at that time, I was the only one who did actual research, I didn\'t even want to do this project, and this project counted to 25% of our final score, so I begrudgingly had to do something even though I wanted to give up. Finally I did 90% of the work, Colt did one page worth of research, Aaron and Brian wrote one measly paragraph and we finally submitted, a week after deadline. Let\'s see if we passed or failed, honestly I think we failed, at least according to me, the research paper was garbage, even the things that I wrote were complete garbage. I mean we were supposed to do a case study and research as sort of or find something new, what were we to do we screening thing, it\'s already researched and upgraded to the max.

To illustrate, I was asked to return the kth largest integer from an unsorted array of integers. I was solving it in python and decided to use heapq to build a min heap of size k and iterate over the array. Once completed the item on top of the heap is the kth largest int. The interviewer didn\'t like that. He told me to instead use the input array itself as a buffer and keep it sorted (O(1) memory). With some struggles I managed to do it, but I think I took a little too long because I was a little flustered at being interrupted regularly and I could not understand his accent at times.

I\'ve seen a few posts regarding dropping out, but I think my situation might be a bit different? I\'m not really sure.I interned at a FAANG company last summer, and got a return offer, so I\'m interning for them again now. My project seems actually meaningful and nontrivial this time, and things seem to be going well.But I have a strong desire to drop out of college (CS degree, have 2 years left), most of which stems from the fact that I think it\'s very expensive and very uninteresting. Last semester was really rough, I remember feeling super disgusted with the fact that I had homework to do, and was generally suicidal because of it.This leads to my beloved personal hobby at the moment, which is competitive programming. Unlike homework problems, the issue isn\'t understanding what you\'re being asked and then following instructions, but instead whether your problem solving skills/creativity are strong enough. I\'m decently satisfied with my improvement, got google code jam rank \\~550 after 2 years of learning :\\^) But anyways, the point is that I feel college is extremely dull in comparison.So back to the question I guess, does anyone have an estimation on the probability of me receiving a fulltime interview from some respectable tech company? In addition to my internships, I\'ve done a few projects, the primary one being a react/aws web app I\'ve worked on for \\~7 months. In theory, I should have a very high interview to offer conversion rate, so it\'s possible that a single interview would suffice.You could also try to convince me not to drop out? idk lol, a much bigger chance of staying alive plus \\~300k of opportunity cost over 2 years seems to outweigh any harm in getting shafted by employers due to no degree imoI\'ve applied to around 5-10 positions so far, and it\'s only been a week or two, but I feel like my inbox is gonna remain empty unless I do more :/Thanks for reading my mini-rant!','cscareers','How difficult is it to get a fulltime software engineering interview as a college dropout?'),('t2_hhddu','','cscareers','The Seven Flags of a Toxic Work Environment.

I still apply because what\'s there to lose, but yeah, to no avail. And now, I got spam emails and random phone calls from Recruiters asking if I\'m interested in Sr. Software Engineer roles. Like bruh.I\'ve had my resume checked and revamped by friends who I consider exceptional students (working at: Twitter, Salesforce, LinkedIn, Amazon), So I don\'t feel like my resume is the issue. I got at least one not-special internship from a small company under my belt so that must mean something I guess.The only thing I feel lacking is that I am a hybrid major (Half CS + Half LA). The college I fall into is LA still so my education says \"BS in Liberal Arts and Computer Science\". I\'m feeling that maybe recruiters just instantly see \"Liberal Arts\" and chuck it away. At the same time, I don\'t feel like my major is that much of a concern as alumni from my major pretty much all end up as software engineers. And the college itself is quite reputable / top ranking in California. But it is a very new and small department with only a handful of students. The pool of alumni is incredibly small with only software engineer examples.I\'m starting to doubt myself on whether I\'m applying to the right things or using my major correctly. I\'ve mainly been applying for software QA roles as TDD feels like the main thing I\'ve taken away from college with friends motioning for me to get into the same field. At the same time, I\'ve been advised to look into consulting positions which I\'ve been applying to as well (but honestly more interested in an engineering role) with about as much success as my software job search.I just don\'t know if I\'m taking the job hunting path correctly. For software engineer roles, I\'ve been trying to learn popular frameworks but feel like there\'s too much new stuff for my bad-at-retaining-memory brain can handle. Unless I\'m doing something consistently, it all disappears from my brain given 1-2 weeks time. I\'ve done probably 200 applications since Spring with only a handful of interviews.Worst to me being that I never was the best programmer. I was known for getting projects done fast, but not efficiently since I brute force hard and stayed up late hours. So my algorithm skills suck which leetcode has made me realize nonstop. Is my direction just bad? Any tips for job hunting for people of my situation?

I feel that there are other MS in CS vs MS in DS reddit posts out there but my confusion is a bit more deep, so I\'ll try my best to structure it well. 1. I do not have a background in CS, most of the folks I\'ve seen do well in Data Science (Analytics or ML Engineer) usually have a bachelor\'s in CS. So should I do a MS in CS. 2. Almost everyone with a MS in Data Science is able to get a job as a data scientist. So I should apply to MS in DS, but it\'ll blow away my cover for Software Engineering roles which I would not like but are a good backup in the long run. 3. Since most software Devs or data scientists will be in management positions later on in their career, it does not matter that I don\'t have backup software engineer roles because I will be a manager and I don\'t like software Dev roles. 4. MS DS programs are few in number and my overall profile is not that good to get into great programs. My background is not in CS so it also limits my options for MS CS. 5. I applied to a mix of MSCS and MSDS programs this year and got into UT Dallas MSCS and USFCA MSDS. I am considering building a stronger profile and applying again but only in either MSCS or MSDS.
