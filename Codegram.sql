But the key to success in CS is certainly the sigma male lifestyle. No need for the warmth or reassurance of others, you just rely on your rock hard will. Similarly the grind mentality is immensely helpful for banging out those leetcode hards. Again, no disrespect, just stating the facts.

I am from a decent Canadian university.The title says it all. I applied to 200+ positions for Summer 2021, and got 2 interviews with no offer. Recently, I received an offer for Summer 2022 from an awesome company.I am going to keep this post short, by writing my key takeaways from the gruesome job search I had for this Summer. It was extremely burning out, depressing, and anxiety invoking.1. You are not the only one. It may seem like you are the only one getting rejected. It may seem like you\'re blacklisted, and that literally nobody wants you. This feeling is understandable, but do know that it is NOT true. You are one amongst 1000s of CS students applying for a job. Solution to this? Get out of your comfort zone and go to networking events. Mail recruiters and people you meet, and keep in touch with them. Ask questions in events, and participate. This will reduce the luck factor involved when applying to that company. This is the number 1 tip, because it greatly reduces the effort applications take.2. Do not compare yourself. Your friend got it in a great company? It doesn\'t impact you. Someone else is making great strides in their internship? It\'s none of your business. Rather, focus this energy on making yourself better. Keep your head up, you have talent too, and your time will come.3. DO. NOT. GIVE. UP. Your time will come. I promise it will. Never give up. Failed an interview? See where you can improve, and practice it. Failed a coding prompt? See the topic, study it, and master it. Resume isn\'t great? Ask people around you, shamelessly post your resume everywhere for critique, and better it. Still didn\'t get an internship (like me)? Ask a 100 professors in your uni for a research position? Still nothing? Make crazy good personal projects, practice LC and volunteer somewhere. Just don\'t give up. You are so close to getting it, just don\'t give up.4. Be yourself in interviews. I do not mean be casual. Be yourself. Express yourself like how you actually are, talk about real takeaways of your life. Each and every one of y\'all are awesome. Discover your interest, and improve on it. Always finish your day being a better person than you were. And yeah, don\'t give up.

INSERT INTO `cscareerquestions` VALUES ('t2_deu5lm1p','Hi there, I\'m a person who spent the last 5 years in the support role. I hated this job a lot, but it is better than not having a job at all, and my family depends on me. I was an experienced IT solutions architect (not in software engineering) in my home country, and was hired by a big tech international company in Europe for a support position on mid-level grade. I thought that was fine since I don\'t have European citizenship. I then quickly realized that they were gonna squeeze all the juice out of me to achieve their business goals and since then I learned programming languages and was engaged in many different projects, I was coding during the nights since my job didn\'t give any chance to code during normal working hours. Despite the fact that some of the projects were really important to our company and were having a big impact, my manager didn\'t allow me to disengage from  my core duties. Even though he admitted the importance of those projects I wasn\'t promoted to senior level nor did I get a salary increase. This is how I realized that he\'s bullshiting me and I have no future in this department. I then tried to apply to internal SWE positions in other departments. It was almost impossible to get the role in my current country since most of the European roles were opened in the UK or in Poland. My hope was to get a relocation and start working at a junior level, it still gives more chances than trying to join another company in the EU without an unrestricted work permit. However all the attempts failed until 3 months ago,  I applied for site reliability engineering position in a different department of my company. All of the sudden, just a few days after a few interviews my manager got me a promotion, I think he realized that I am about to quit. Anyway I got the offer. The position offered software engineering duties - actually a lot of job time is coding. My support position helped to get it because it requires systems engineering and troubleshooting skills too. That was a big success and I am pretty happy I finally left the customer support departmentand can start the new journey in the new team which seems to be very nice and supportive.','cscareerquestions','I finally got my first software engineering related job.',1),('t2_87pj9xmf','I’ve seen so many posts of people trying so hard to get FANNG jobs and get so many recommended videos of “interning at Facebook” etc. I understand the pay is good but there is so many people trying to get those jobs I’d feel so stressed out trying to keep it.','cscareerquestions','Am I the only one who doesn’t want a FANNG job?',2),('t2_bm6hu','When I was a new dev, and the person training me was asking me if I was familiar with something, I was always afraid to say no out of fear that I might seem unqualified or incompetent, or that I\'m expected to know it.Or if someone was explaining something to me, and I was totally lost, I was afraid to stop them to ask questions, especially if I was being trained as part of a group that seemed to understand it fine.I\'m now in the position where I\'ve started helping others, and I\'ve realized a few things:1.Someone explaining something to you that you already know can be very annoying or even come across as condescending, even if the intent is not there.A good way to avoid this is to ask if someone is familiar with a topic. Me asking \"Are you familiar with merge statements in SQL\" is not me trying to judge you, I just want to determine if I need to explain it or not, so I don\'t offend you by spending 5 minutes explaining something you already know. 2.As an experienced dev, when training others, It\'s very easy to go too fast and omit important details. But when you ask the person you\'re helping if the explanation makes sense, they may feel inclined to say yes even if they\'re quite lost, out of fear that you\'ll judge them or get annoyed. Quite often if they\'re lost, it\'s because my explanation was terrible and I went way too fast, but from their perspective they might just feel like they\'re in over their head and not good enough.University won\'t teach you every thing you need to know, and even if you start a 2nd or 3rd job, you likely won\'t know all the frameworks the new company uses as there are thousands. It\'s understandable to not know things, and normal to need training/assistance, that\'s why senior developers make so much more money. If a company is hiring a junior developer, it\'s usually because they\'re looking to hire someone they can train into a role, and hope they stick with the company a long time. With the exception of maybe some ultra-competitive workplaces like Capital One, or some startups, they\'re not looking to get rid of someone after a few months if they aren\'t a rockstar programmer. Recruiting is expensive, and quite often they\'re just as worried about you leaving as you are about them firing you.','cscareerquestions','To Junior Devs: Don\'t be afraid to admit you don\'t know or understand something',3),('t2_3jnfa99e','I\'m a developer with 2 years of professional experience.

I just want to rant and encourage people to keep looking for remote jobs and make the transition if they can/prefer it.So last week, after a year or so working from home, I had to go back (for the first time in my career) into the office. According to my company, we should work from the office because it will increase collaboration and people will perform better.  Bunch of bs, but I had no other choice at the moment.So first things first, instead of waking up at 8:20 and join a useless meeting at 8:30, be on mute and proceed to go make my breakfast and take my dog for a walk,  I now have to wake up at 7, get properly dressed (no more comfortable clothes), make sure I have lunch and breakfast prepped, get on the highway, drive, get there at 8:15, mindless chit chat till 8:30, join the same useless meeting on zoom (with coworkers from around the globe, what\'s the f. point? ) and now I HAVE to/MUST pretend to pay attention to something that has no relation to what I work with because well, I got no more flexibility on my surrounding environment.At home, I invested in a nice work setup. I have a nice chair, a stand-up desk, wireless keyboard/mouse/headphones, 2 monitors that I can adjust, plus a private kitchen to make my snacks, and teas.The first time I went to the office and I saw the work environment I felt ridiculous. It\'s a fucking cubicle, with a shitty keyboard, mouse, and headset. The best part is that the cubicle doesn\'t have tall walls so I can literally see/hear everything, including other people\'s monitors.  The monitors, of course, are facing the hallway, so you can\'t see who\'s walking behind you, but whoever walks past you can freely see what you are doing.  Manager\'s dream.I also have to wait in line now if I want to make some tea or something, delightful.At home, I am able to have a quiet environment and be super productive. When I get a card, depending on what it is, I can finish it in 2-4 hours, and then I can focus on doing something else for the rest of the day (learning/training, other meetings, or just not work at all since I was able to be productive).At the office, because of being constantly watched, I became lazy just to have something to hold on to/last for the rest of the day. I also noticed that my team members do the same.  Also for me, IT IS EXTREMELY HARD to actually focus with a lot of background noise and as I mentioned above, because of the cubicles, every time someone gets up (every 10 mins), or gets a phone call, my attention is drawn to that and I lose what focus I had.The company kept saying we will be more productive at the office. That\'s the opposite of what I am seeing. My team is now taking longer for cards, and the amount of time wasted in the office is ridiculous. The number of people, mindless walking around, chit-chatting in cubicles, going out for lunch/ coffee breaks just to fill in the time is a joke(nothing wrong with that IMO, but I\'d rather do that at home).I loved having a private bathroom at my house. I can go and do whatever I want to do in peace. At the office, welcome to the shitty stalls and pooping side by side because, yes, I do love the smell of people farting in the morning.The people that wanted to go back into the office, after a week of going to work and lunches and whatnot, started to mention some stuff during the stand-ups and I quote:\"Are you guys feeling more tired than usual?  I forgot I didn\'t enjoy the commute\"\"Man I forgot it sucked to have to prep a meal every day and wait in line in the cafeteria to reheat it\"\"I actually didn\'t realize I was saving money eating at home, I spent over 100 dollars last week on coffee and lunch\".At home, after work, I could go for a jog right away or just go watch some Netflix and chill out.At the office after a long, tiring day? Nope, get in the car, you are going to waste 40 minutes in stressful traffic to get home.&amp;#x200B;I am FUCKING glad, I am putting in my 2 weeks this Wednesday and going fully remote. I started looking 4 months ago when the company announced their plans because I was feeling that this office thing would be horrible. I tried it out and it just doesn\'t work for me.If you are looking for a remote role, keep applying/interviewing, you will get something too.If you like/prefer going to the office that is fine. I am not trying to say we should all be remote. Companies should offer FLEXIBILITY to let employees choose where to work from.We have different personalities and different preferences. Just because some people enjoy going into the office (or because management needs control) doesn\'t mean everyone has to.&amp;#x200B;I am gladly never going to or near an office ever again.&amp;#x200B;TL;DR: Went to the office for the first time in my life. I hated it and makes no sense to me.  Companies should let employees decide where to work from.

I am an Electronics and Communications engineer and have been working as a data analyst for the past 3 years. Most of my work also entails predictive models like XGBoost and recently I have also picked up some NLP. Now I am looking to apply for a Masters degree. I feel that there are other MS in CS vs MS in DS reddit posts out there but my confusion is a bit more deep, so I\'ll try my best to structure it well. 1. I do not have a background in CS, most of the folks I\'ve seen do well in Data Science (Analytics or ML Engineer) usually have a bachelor\'s in CS. So should I do a MS in CS. 2. Almost everyone with a MS in Data Science is able to get a job as a data scientist. So I should apply to MS in DS, but it\'ll blow away my cover for Software Engineering roles which I would not like but are a good backup in the long run. 3. Since most software Devs or data scientists will be in management positions later on in their career, it does not matter that I don\'t have backup software engineer roles because I will be a manager and I don\'t like software Dev roles. 4. MS DS programs are few in number and my overall profile is not that good to get into great programs. My background is not in CS so it also limits my options for MS CS. 5. I applied to a mix of MSCS and MSDS programs this year and got into UT Dallas MSCS and USFCA MSDS. I am considering building a stronger profile and applying again but only in either MSCS or MSDS.
